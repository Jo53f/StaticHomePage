      <h2>About this site</h2>

      <div id="content">
        <p>This website intended to be a portfolio for everything I've done during the Generation Cloud Practitioner Course. You'll find various projects with some details on how they were completed.</p>
        <p>Other projects, which I have completed in my own time will also be included, though it'll be clear which group each project belongs to in their respective details section.</p>
        <p>Make sure to visit all the pages on the navigation bar to see everything I've done. And as the title suggests, this website is hosted on Azure as a static website.</p>
