            <h4>Java SpringBoot - Foreign Currency</h4>
            <p>Used Java (Spring Boot) to build a RESTful microservice that fetches and manages currencies from an SQL database. Specifically, it leverages Spring Data JDBC to connect to PostgreSQL via Docker Compose for persistence management.</p>
            <p>The application comprises two key components: First, a CurrencyController class provides REST APIs at GET /api/currency/* that returns currency data either from an embedded JSON file or SQL database depending on initialization. Second, during startup, Spring's `CommandLineRunner` is used to load records into the PostgreSQL table ensuring quick deployment without manual setup.</p>
